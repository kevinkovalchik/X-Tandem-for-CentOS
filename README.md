# X-Tandem-for-CentOS
A verbatim clone of X! Tandem, version Alanine, but with release builds compiled in CentOS 7.

#### Why do we need it?

We have found that the current release of X! Tandem (Alanine) is not compatible with CentOS 7. Rather than deal with some way to work around the issue, we have recompiled X! Tandem in CentOS 7, yielding a compatible executable.

#### Please do not raise issues with us!

We do not maintain X! Tandem, we just use it. If you encounter a problem with X! Tandem, plese contact the developers.
