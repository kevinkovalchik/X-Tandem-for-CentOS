# X-Tandem-for-CentOS
A verbatim clone of X! Tandem, version Alanine, but with release builds compiled in CentOS 7.

#### Why do we need it?

We have found that the current release of X! Tandem (Alanine) is not compatible with CentOS 7. Rather than deal with some way to work around the issue, we have recompiled X! Tandem in CentOS 7, yielding a compatible executable. This is not a complicated operation, but we have decided to provide the results here. The CentOS7-compatible version of `tandem.exe` can be found in the `bin` directory.

#### Please do not raise issues with us!

We do not maintain X! Tandem, we just use it. If you encounter a problem with X! Tandem, please contact the developers.
